# VASP
Here, I have included a plethora of VASP examples for input calculations. Most of these calculations are for Topological materials in a supercell with a thick vacuum (surface calculations). I have included some Plots suchas 
- Bandstructure
- Density of States
- Fermi Surfaces (Spectral Functions)
