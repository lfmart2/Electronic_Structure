# VASP Input Files
Here, I included all the input files to run VASP for:
Relaxation -> SCF -> Bandstructure/DOS/FermiSurface
Relaxation -> SCF -> NSCF -> Wannierization (W90) -> TB model
for the following configurations:
- Collinear Spin, non Spin Orbit Coupling (SOC), for Supercell 1 x 1 x 7 without adsorbed Hydrogen atom
- Collinear Spin (non-SOC) for **High Coverage** (Supercell 1 x 1 x 7) with adsorbed Hydrogen atom
- non Collinear Spin (SOC) for  the Supercell 1 x 1 x 7 without adsorbed Hydrogen atom
- non Collinear Spin (SOC) for **High Coverage** (Supercell 1 x 1 x 7) with adsorbed Hydrogen atom
- non Collinear Spin (SOC) for the Supercell 2 x 1 x 7 without adsorbed Hydrogen atom
- non Collinear Spin (SOC) for **Low Coverage** (Supercell w x 1 x 7) with adsorbed Hydrogen atom
